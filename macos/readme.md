# Settings

This directory includes all of my old custom settings and dotfiles for macOS. They have been generalized as much as possible for use by other people, but they are mostly just for my personal use.

The setup script will check to see if `zsh` is installed.  If `zsh` is installed, and it is not already configured as the default shell, the setup script will execute a `chsh -s $(which zsh)`.  This changes the default shell to zsh, and takes effect as soon as a new zsh is spawned or on next login.

I remap my keyboard so that the control is caps lock, and caps lock key is control, but it's only control if you press it in combination with another key, otherwise it's escape. And then my enter/return key is control if pressed in combination, otherwise it's enter.

The `scripts/install.sh` script will:

1. Install zsh and set it as the default shell
1. Install Homebrew
1. Install Homebrew packages
1. Install npm
1. Install npm packages
1. Create symlinks to the dotfiles in `~/settings/dotfiles/` in your home directory
1. Install neovim plugins
1. Install gui apps with Homebrew Cask
