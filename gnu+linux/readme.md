# Settings

This directory includes all of my custom settings and dotfiles for GNU+Linux.

I am currently using Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS.

The `scripts/install.sh` script will:

1. Install packages
1. Create symlinks to the dotfiles in `~/settings/dotfiles/` in your home directory and backup old dotfiles to `~/.OLD_DOTFILES`

## Manual Settings

- Tweak Tool
  - Typing
    - Ctrl key position: Swap Ctrl and Caps Lock
